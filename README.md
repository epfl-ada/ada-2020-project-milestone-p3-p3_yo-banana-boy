|| Title
Potential influences a vote : analysis of a signed social media

|| Abstract 
While the paper studies application and relevance of different social theories in signed networks of social media, we are here interested in focusing 
on detecting what parameters of said signed graphs can influence the outcome of an election. In particular, we want to focus on the Wikipedia elections, in order to answer the general question : what can influence the votes ? 
We will focus firstly on temporal evolutions of the votes outcomes. Secondly we will try to analyze how the structure of a signed network can influence the votes of its members. The study of the graph's structure will for example aim at telling if people with a smaller social circle (less connections) are more prompt to vote positively for people with bigger social circles. 
Lastly, we will build a 4D visualization .... TBC



|| Research Questions 
- Can temporal patterns for votes be detected ? ie, are some times periods more favorable for someone to be elected ? 
- Can one's position in a social network influence the outcome of one's election, or one's vote ? 
- To what extend all that can be observed in a social networks within which interactions are signed ? 

|| Proposed dataset
We here will only analyze the Wikielec dataset, which is one of the three datasets used in the paper studied previously. 
We chose this dataset becaus eit is the only one where the dates and times of the elections and votes are given and can therefore be analyzed.
