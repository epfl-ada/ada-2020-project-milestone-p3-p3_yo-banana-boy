|| Title
Tell us what you got Wikipedia! How social network structure potentially influences voting: analysis of a signed social network

|| Abstract 
While the paper studies application and relevance of different social theories in signed social media networks, we are interested in discovering what more can be found out from the given datasets. We thus want to focus on detecting what parameters of the said signed graphs can influence the outcome of an election. In particular, we want to focus on the Wikipedia elections, in order to answer the general question : what can influence the votes ? 
We will first focus on the temporal evolution of the voting outcomes. Secondly, we will try to analyze how the structure of a signed network can influence the votes of its members. The study of the graph's structure will for example aim at telling if people with a smaller social circle (less connections) are more prompt to vote positively for people with bigger social circles. 
Lastly, we will build a 4D visualization .... TBC



|| Research Questions 
- Can temporal patterns for votes be detected? I.e. are some times periods more favorable for someone to be elected? Is there a certain pattern over time?
- Can one's position in a social network influence the outcome of one's election, or one's vote ? 
- To what extend all that can be observed in a social networks within which interactions are signed ? 

|| Proposed dataset
We focus on the Wikielec dataset, which is one of the three datasets used in the paper studied previously. 
We chose this dataset because it is the only one where the dates and times of the elections and votes are given and can therefore be analyzed. Indeed, we believe that this dataset can be used for richer signed network analysis than what has been done in the paper.
